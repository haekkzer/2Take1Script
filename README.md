## Setup

Download the latest script release from [**#lua-script-share**](https://discord.com/channels/570999086874886154/614871694938472507) or from this git-repo [**download**](https://github.com/haekkzer/2Take1Script/files/5751199/2Take1Script.zip). The script comes in a `2Take1Script.zip` file.

Extract the `.zip` file in the `scripts` folder from the menu (see the [**Scripts Guide**](https://docs.2take1.menu/features/local/scripts) for further details).
If done right, your `scripts` folder should contain:

- `2Take1Script.lua` (main script)
- `2Take1Script\` (folder with additional assets)

![help1](/pics/setup_01.jpg)

![help2](/pics/setup_02.jpg)

Once all the above is done, you can straight go to [**Scripts**](https://docs.2take1.menu/features/local/scripts) and select **2Take1Script.lua**.

If you have a problem loading this script, have a look [**here**](#common-questions).

## Customize the Script

In order to customize the script, you have to edit the `2Take1Script\2Take1ScriptEXT.lua` file.

Although any text editor will do the work, I'd recommend a specialized code editor, such as **Notepad++**, **Visual Studio Code**, **Atom** or **Sublime Text**.

If you add something to a variable, set it to the last entry.

Here's an example:

```lua
-- This is RIGHT
local array = {
    {"Entry X", 10},
    {"Entry Y", 40},
    {"New Entry", -1},
}

-- This is WRONG
local array = {
    {"Entry X", 10},
    {"New Entry", -1},
    {"Entry Y", 40},
}
```

### Custom Script Events

Edit the `_2t1s_se_custom` global variable.

```lua
_2t1s_se_custom = {
    {"Custom Script Event 1", {
        {0xffffffff, {0, 0, 0}},
        {0xffffffff, {0, 0, 0}},
        {0xffffffff, {}},
    } },
    {"Custom Script Event 2", {
        {0xaaaaaaaa, {1, -1}},
        {0xffffffff, {0, 0, 0}},
    } },
}
```

### Attacker / Assassin PEDs

Edit the `_2t1s_ped_assassins` global variable.

```lua
_2t1s_ped_assassins = {
--  {"Attacker Name", ped_Hash, ped_Type},
    {"Cop", 0x5E3DA4A4, 6},
    {"FIB", 0x5CDEF405, 6},
    {"Juggernaut", 0x90EF5134, 4},
    {"Bigfoot", 0x61D4C771, 28},
}
```

### Punish Money Beggers

Edit the `_2t1s_begger_texts` global variable.

```lua
_2t1s_begger_texts = {
--  "Beg String 1", "Beg String 2, "Beg String 3", "...",
    "money please", "gib mal money hier", "any money dropper", "money dropper anyone?"
}
```

### License Plate Speedometer

Edit the `_2t1s_speedometer_units` global variable.

2Take1Script will convert from **meters per second** to the desired unit. Because of this, you need the **multiply factor** that will be applied in the conversion.

Don't forget to leave a blank space before the short name, otherwise the speed won't be displayed properly.

```lua
_2t1s_speedometer_units = {
--  {" Short Unit", mply_Factor, "Long Unit"},
    {" MPS", 1, "Meter per Second"},
    {" MPH", 2.23694, "Miles per Hour"},
    {" KMH", 3.6, "Kilometers per Hour"},
}
```

- The first unit, MPS, is the default unit, so it uses a multiplier of **1**.
- The third unit, KPH, equals **3.6** times the MPS unit (because 1 kph = 3.6 mps).

### Block Custom Areas

Edit the `_2t1s_block_custom` global variable.

The last line of each custom location will add a **Teleporting Position**.

Instead of setting a fixed position, you can place the objects at a random generated position.  
To do this, instead of typing the exact coordinates as shown above, use the following format:  
`{nil, X1, X2, Y1, Y2, Z1, Z2}`

- `nil` defines that the coordinates will be randomly generated within a prism, whose vertices will be specified next.
- `X1` and `X2` define the range of coordinates for the X axis.
- `Y1` and `Y2` define the range of coordinates for the Y axis.
- `Z1` and `Z2` define the range of coordinates for the Z axis.

And always remember, **the first value has to be the smaller one**.

```lua
_2t1s_block_custom = {
--  {"Example", {
--      {hash, {pos X, Y, Z}, {rot X, Y, Z}, bool_Freeze, bool_Invisible},
--      {false, {teleport_Pos X, Y, Z}, float_Heading},
--      }, },
    {"Block Orbital Room", {
        {3291218330, {335.9567565918, 4834.3325195312, -58.686454772949}, {0, 0, 35}, true, true},
        {3291218330, {326.33291625977, 4827.6704101562, -60.25874710083}, {0, -90, 0}, true, true},
        {false, {342.8, 4838.2, -57}, 121.2},
        }, },
    {"Trees Main LSC", {
        {3015194288, {nil, -415, -350, -165, -97, 36, 45}, {0, 0, 0}, true, false},
        {3015194288, {nil, -415, -350, -165, -97, 36, 45}, {0, 0, 0}, true, false},
        {3015194288, {nil, -415, -350, -165, -97, 36, 45}, {0, 0, 0}, true, false},
        {3015194288, {nil, -415, -350, -165, -97, 36, 45}, {0, 0, 0}, true, false},
        {3015194288, {nil, -415, -350, -165, -97, 36, 45}, {0, 0, 0}, true, false},
        {false, {-370.4, -104.72, 47}, -110.83449554443},
        }, },
}
```

### Custom Attachments

Edit the `_2t1s_custom_attachments` global variable.

Each attachment can be made of many entities; you only have to add more entity identifiers.

```lua
_2t1s_custom_attachments = {
--    {"Name", {
--      {hash, bone_ID, {pos X, Y, Z}, {rot X, Y, Z}, bool_Invisible},
--      }, },
    {"DEMI-GOD - Light", {
        {148511758, 0, {0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0}, true},
        }, },
    {"DEMI-GOD - Heavy", {
        {148511758, 0, {0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0}, true},
        {3291218330, 0, {0, 0, -3.5}, {0, 90, 0}, true},
        {3291218330, 0, {0, 0, 0}, {0, 90, 0}, true},
        {3291218330, 0, {0, 0, 3.5}, {0, 90, 0}, true},
        }, },
    {"Cat Cap", {
        {0x573201B8, 119, {0, -0.075, 0.3}, {0, 0, 0}},
        }, },
}
```

The third example, "Cat Cap", uses a **ped hash**.

### New Custom Vehicles

Edit the `_2t1s_custom_vehicles` global variable.

This is the most complicated part of the Lua, but let's take it step by step.

1. The first line contains all **vehicle/object hashes** you want to use for the custom vehicle.
2. The next lines will define how each vehicle/object will be placed in the custom vehicle. You have to repeat this line for every hash you defined above. Keep in mind that the first of the hashes will define the **starting vehicle**.

- `hash`  
  This is the hash to which the next parameters will be applied.
- `{pos X, Y, Z}`  
  Set the offset of the entity.
- `{rot X, Y, Z}`  
  Set the rotation of the entity.
- `{primary_Color, secondary_Color, pearlescent, wheel, window}`  
  If the entity is a vehicle, set the primary/secondary/pearlescent/wheel color (all HEX RGB) and the window tint (0 to 3).
- `bool_Invisible`  
  Set this to `true` to render the entity invisible.
- `int_SpawnHeight`  
  If you have a plane as a starting vehicle, this value will let you spawn it at a certain amount of meters above the current location.
- `int_BoneIndex`  
  Set a boneindex if you want to attach something, for example, to the wheels.
- `int_AttachToEntity`  
  By default, everything will be attached to the first (starting) vehicle. To change that, just set it to the line number defining the vehicle where it should be attached.
- `ped_Hash`  
  To get the engine of a helicopter/plane running, you can set here a ped hash. The ped will be spawned into the vehicle, and the doors will be locked after it.
- `bool_NoCollision`  
  Set it to `true` to disable the collision for this entity.
- `int_Offset`  
  Defines how many meters away the entity should be spawned in front of you (especially for the preview).
- `int_OffsetZPreview`  
  Defines the height of the vehicle during the preview.
- `int_Alpha`  
  Some vehicles will glitch put if you render them invisible. Instead, set the Alpha to `0`.

The position/rotation *should* always be `nil` for the starting vehicle.

Setting some value to `nil` will set the default setting for it.  
For example, the color for each vehicle will be randomly selected.

Setting the starting vehicle's hash to `0` will check if you're in a vehicle and if the "Use own Vehicle" option is enabled.  
If that's the case, your current vehicle will become the "base", on which the rest of the entities will be attached.

```lua
_2t1s_custom_vehicles = {
--  {"Name", {
--      {hash1, hash2, hash3, ...}
--      {hash, {pos X, Y, Z}, {rot X, Y, Z}, {primary_Color, secondary_Color, pearlescent, wheel, window}, bool_Invisible, int_SpawnHeight, int_BoneIndex, int_AttachToEntity, ped_Hash, bool_NoCollision, int_Offset, int_OffsetZPreview, int_Alpha},
--      }, },
    {"WarMachine", {
        {0x9dae1398, 1030400667, 0x2F03547B, 2971578861, 3871829598, 3229200997, 0x187D938D, 782665360},
        {0x9dae1398, nil, nil, {0, 0, 0, 0, 1}, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, 15},
        {1030400667, {0, -4, 0}, nil, {0, 0, 0, 0, 1}},
        {0x2F03547B, {0, -8, 4}, {-90, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0, 0, 1}, true, nil, nil, nil, 0x97F5FE8D, true},
        {2971578861, {-0.3, -0.6, 9.8}, {-90, 0, 0}, nil, nil, nil, 16, 3},
        }, },
    {"Attach Ramp", {
        {3233397978},
        {0},
        {3233397978, {0, 4.5, 0.25}, {0, 0, 180}},
        }, },
}
```

### Vehicle Lag Area

Edit the `_2t1s_vehicle_lag_area` global variable.

```lua
_2t1s_vehicle_lag_area = {
--  {"Name", Hash},
    {"Cargoplanes", 0x15F27762},
    {"Volatols", 0x1AAD0DED},
}
```

### Bounty

Edit the `_2t1s_bounty_amount` global variable.

The amount value must be between 0 and 10000.

```lua
_2t1s_bounty_amount = {
--  amount1, amount2, amount3, ...
    0, 1, 10, 69, 420, 666, 1337, 5555, 9999, 10000
}
```

## Known Issues

- **Kick Hosts until You become Host** can cause issues!
- Too many **Custom Vehicles / PEDs / Objects** may cause issues! Just delete them after use.
- **Realtime** is likely to make the clouds flash (this should be fixed, but doesn't work 100%).
- After disabling **2Take1Script-Parent**, you have to reload the script
- Some features won't work properly if the distance between you and the target is too long.
- When the script gets autoloaded (for example, with an `autoexec.lua`), the **Event Listeners** (Chat features, etc) might not work.
- If you crash on inject / script load, delete the `2Take1Script.ini` file in the `2Take1Script\Config` folder.
- For some users Moist autoload folder will crash the game. -\> Instead use my autoload-Feature
- Teleport to Waypoint will teleport you near a street.
- Enabling Vehicle Colors might wont apply, press the Feature a few times.

## Notes

1. These features are disabled by default. You may enable them by setting `enable_rockstar_admin_kick_crash` to `true` at the end of the **2Take1ScriptEXT.lua** file, but keep in mind that ***this will nullify any Ban Report you may fill up in the future!***
2. There's always chances to get some false positives. I keep looking into reducing the false positive rate.
3. If you use **Block** features while having this enabled, you'll be teleported to the location right before it will be blocked.
4. These will spawn explosions all over the map, though you better not expect people from dying of it. Due to how GTA works, explosions won't spawn sometimes if the distance between you and the explosion is too long.
5. This feature will spawn 50 Vehicles at the Target. You can choose from a custom list of vehicles.
6. To detect a money begger, it will search the chat for phrases like "give me money". Since I can't predict every constellation of begging strings, you can add own phrases to the detection.
7. **\[SU\]** stands for Script User. Since these commands are very powerful and could be abused, I decided to set them only usable by yourself.
8. Pressing **`E`** while this feature is enabled will spawn a few explosions in the direction you're moving. When setting the value from `Enable Horn for Player` to a valid Player ID, the Explosive Beam will be set for the selected Player. To take affect you have to reenable this feature.
9. This will load a weapon choice of mine. If you don't like it, you can edit which weapons will be loaded.
10. Currently, there are 14 Units to display the speed. If it's still not enough, you can add some of your own.
11. The feature `Lobby Information` will only be visible, when you enter a new session.
12. You have to create the folder yourself, i wont deliever this folder in my script.  
After enabling this option, the script will sleep and then load all scripts with the extention `.lua`.

## Common Questions

> How do I add stuff?

- See [**Customize the Script**](#customize-the-script)

> How do I enter a Custom Vehicle?

- Enable **Spawn in Vehicle** under **Settings**.

> Some vehicles won't work, like "Attach Ramp"

- Enable **Use own Vehicle**, and enter any car.

> Does it work with other scripts?

- It should work - it has been tested with a few other scripts. But i dont officially support co-loads.

> Does it work after a GTA Update?

- Chances are very high for all **Script Event** features to break; everything else *should* be fine.

> Does it work after a 2T1 Update?

- Yes, under normal circumstances.

> How do I reset the script config?

- Delete the  `2Take1Script.ini` file in the  `2Take1Script\Config` folder.

> My game crashed when i load the script?

- Delete the  `2Take1Script.ini` file in the  `2Take1Script\Config` folder.

> I dont see the Script in the menu?

- Press "Refresh Scripts"

> The kick from the script did not worked on a player?

- The kick will only not work, when the target is a modder. He is probably blocking the script events.

> I downloaded the new version, but i dont see the new features?

- Clear the cache of the Browser and make sure you deleted every old file.

> I dont see the Online-Player Features?

- They are not in Local -\> Script Features located. Go to the Online Tab and select a Player. Under Script Features you will see the Features.

> How do i autoload this script?

- Rename this script to `autoexec.lua`

> I have already a file called `autoexec.lua`?

- Rename the other file and use my Autoload-Feature

> How do i use the autoload feature?

- Create a folder `autoload` in the scripts folder and place the script you wish to get loaded inside.  
  In the game, select my script -\> Miscellaneous -\> Utils -\> `autoexec Scripts from folder 'autoload'`
- Or Create a new file called `autoexec.lua` and paste this into it:

    ```lua
    if not require("2Take1Script") then
        ui.notify_above_map("ERROR Loading Script, returning!", "Auto-Loader", 208)
    end
    ```

- Or just paste the code snippet above to your other `autoexec.lua`
